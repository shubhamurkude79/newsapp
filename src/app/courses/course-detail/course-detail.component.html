            <p>The Angular is the newest form of the AngularJS, developed by Google, which is an open-source
                front-end development platform used for building mobile and desktop web applications.
                Angular is rewritten by the same team that built AngularJS.</p>
            <p>It is a JavaScript framework for building web applications and apps in JavaScript, HTML, and
                TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. The Angular now comes with every latest
                feature you need to build a complex and sophisticated web or mobile application. It contains
                features like component, Directives, Forms, Pipes, HTTP Services, Dependency Injection and
                many more. </p>
            <p>Angular is the next big deal. Being the successor of the massive successful AngularJS
                framework itâ€™s bound to frame the future of frontend development in a similar way. The
                powerful features and capabilities of Angular permit you to build complex, customizable,
                modern, responsive and user-friendly web applications. It also enables you to create
                software quicker and with less effort.</p>
            <p>As your application grows, structuring your code in a clean and maintainable and more
                importantly, testable way, becomes more complex. But your life becomes far easier using a
                framework like Angular.

                Angular 7 is the latest version of the Angular framework and simply an update to Angular 2.

                Angular is faster than AngularJS and offers a much more flexible and modular development
                approach. After studying this tutorial you become proficient and able to take full advantage
                of all those features and start developing incredible applications in a reasonable time.</p>
